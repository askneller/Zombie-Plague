# Zombie Plague

A zombie survival mod for Minecraft

### Features:
- Zombies are the only monsters that spawn, and no longer catch fire in the sun,
- Zombies can no longer summon aid
- Zombies spawn on the surface, the same as regular animals (can do with some tweaking),
- Player hunger deteriorates faster than the base game,
- Domesticated animals (cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens) spawn at reduced rates,
- Villages have no inhabitants (villagers or golems)

To be implemented:
- Villages no longer spawn,
- Crafting recipe/s for string,
- Increase drop rate for flint from gravel,
- New items,
- New zombie behaviours (attracted to light and sound)
- Settings (spawn rates etc.) adjustable via config files,
- Reduced spawn rate of all creatures

[//]: # (Source installation information for modders)

[//]: # (-------------------------------------------)

[//]: # (This code follows the Minecraft Forge installation methodology. It will apply)

[//]: # (some small patches to the vanilla MCP source code, giving you and it access )

[//]: # (to some of the data and functions you need to build a successful mod.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Note also that the patches are built against "un-renamed" MCP source code &#40;aka)

[//]: # (SRG Names&#41; - this means that you will not be able to read them directly against)

[//]: # (normal code.)

[//]: # (Setup Process:)

[//]: # (==============================)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Step 1: Open your command-line and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Step 2: You're left with a choice.)

[//]: # (If you prefer to use Eclipse:)

[//]: # (1. Run the following command: `gradlew genEclipseRuns` &#40;`./gradlew genEclipseRuns` if you are on Mac/Linux&#41;)

[//]: # (2. Open Eclipse, Import > Existing Gradle Project > Select Folder )

[//]: # (   or run `gradlew eclipse` to generate the project.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (If you prefer to use IntelliJ:)

[//]: # (1. Open IDEA, and import project.)

[//]: # (2. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.)

[//]: # (3. Run the following command: `gradlew genIntellijRuns` &#40;`./gradlew genIntellijRuns` if you are on Mac/Linux&#41;)

[//]: # (run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `gradlew clean` to reset everything )

[//]: # ({this does not affect your code} and then start the process again.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Mapping Names:)

[//]: # (=============================)

[//]: # (By default, the MDK is configured to use the official mapping names from Mojang for methods and fields )

[//]: # (license, if you do not agree with it you can change your mapping names to other crowdsourced names in your )
